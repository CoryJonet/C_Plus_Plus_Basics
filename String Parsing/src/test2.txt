There are both written homeworks and programs in this course. Programs focus on course topics. Grading is based on both correctness and programming style. You write C programs. You will be expected to design algorithms and organize code for these programs. Algorithm details will not often be covered in class. You are expected to write grammatically correct, clear documentation for the code. A description of our expectations for programs is given in this Guidelines for Programs document. You will generally not be given test cases for your programs. So, you will need to identify reasonable test cases, and test your own program with them.
